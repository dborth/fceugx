- FCE Ultra GameCube Edition -

Hello again! This great emulator, for this great console was in "el olvido",
so, again, I've decided to add it some new changes to make it a little most complete,
please, keep source code when you made a change, this is an open source project.

This new version have asako and _svpe_ lastest added options.

Enjoy it!
Askot.

What's new [20080331]

+[Askot]
- Fixed/changed SDCARD slot selection for searching roms, at 
  start you will be prompted for this option.
- Code cleanup.

+[dsbomb]
- Added Wii mode support.
- Give a "Bad cartridge" error instead of locking up.
- Joystick fixes due to libogc r14's changed stick values
- Rearranged menu to make more sense, and consistent with Snes9x
- Add "Reboot" menu option
- Removed "." directory from SD card listing, it's pointless
- Expand DVD reading to DVD9 size (once DVDs are working again)
- Added option to go back a menu by pressing B.

What's new? Askot [20080326]
- Added saving state in SD Card (State files will be saved in root of SDCARD).
  *Note: I can't make it work to save in root:\fceu\saves, so help needed.
- Added SDCARD slot selection for searching roms, meaning, you can search roms 
  from SDCARD SLOT A & SLOT B (Beta, meaning, buggy, but works).
- For standarization, you must create folders root:\fceu\roms to read NES 
  roms files from SDCARD.
- Added C-Left to call Menu.
- Reading files from SD Card it's faster, now they're called from cache
  after first reading.
- Menu in saving STATE file changed to choose SLOT, DEVICE, Save STATE, 
  Load STATE, Return to previous. 
- Added option PSO/SD Reload to menu, still works (START+B+X)
- Modified controls when going into the rom selection menu (DVD or 
  SDCARD):
  + Use B to quit selection list.
  + Use L/R triggrers or Pad Left/Right to go down/up one full page.
- Some menu rearrangment and a little of sourcecode cleanup: 
  + Everytime you pressed B button on any option, playgame started, not anymore
  until you select Play Game option.

What's new? asako [20070831]
- modify mmc3 code for Chinese pirated rom
- add some Chinese pirated rom mappers

What's new? _svpe_ [20070607]
- Wii support (PAL50 fix, 1.35GiB restriction removed)
- 7zip ROM loading support from the DVD (not from a SD card!!)
- dvd_read fix (the read data was always copied to readbuffer instead of *dst)
- slower file selection when using the D-Pad (I didn't like the selection to go 
as fast as in the latest release)
