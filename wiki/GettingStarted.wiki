= Setup & Installation =

Unzip the archive. You will find the following folders inside:

 * apps - Contains Homebrew Channel ready files (see Homebrew Channel instructions below)
 * executables - Contains Gamecube / Wii DOL files (for loading from other methods)
 * fceugx - Contains the directory structure required for storing roms and saves (see below)

== Wii - Via the Homebrew Channel ==

The most popular method of running homebrew on the Wii is through the [http://hbc.hackmii.com/ Homebrew Channel]. If you already have the channel installed, just copy over the apps folder
included in the archive into the root of your SD card.

Remember to also create the fceugx directory structure required. See below.

== GameCube == 

You can load FCEUGX via sdload and an SD card in slot A, or by streaming 
it to your Gamecube, or by booting a bootable DVD with FCEUGX on it. 
This document doesn't cover how to do any of that. A good source for information 
on these topics is the [http://www.tehskeen.com/forums/ TehSkeen Forums]

= ROMs, Preferences, and Saves =

 * ROMs & saves files should be stored in '''fceugx/roms''' and '''fceugx/saves''' on the root of you SD card, USB flash drive, or SMB share. You can copy the fceugx directory from the archive to your support drive.

== Loading From DVD or Windows Network Share (SMB) ==
 * ROMs can be burned to a DVD-/+R (4.7GB max size & ISO 9660 file format) but you need to install the [[DVDx]] on your Wii. More infos on [http://hackmii.com/2008/08/libdi-and-the-dvdx-installer/ HackMii].
 * To load roms from a Windows network share (SMB) you will have to edit FCEUGX.xml on your SD card with your network settings, or edit fceuconfig.cpp from the source code and compile.
